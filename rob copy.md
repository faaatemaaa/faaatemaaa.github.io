Greetings to all. My name is Fatema Ahmed Alsalhadi and I am currently a
student at Arizona State University, where I am pursuing a degree in
Robotics Engineering. I have always possessed a strong passion for
innovation, technology, and robotics. Furthermore, I got awarded the
title of ambassador of innovation and ambassador of sustainability. In
addition, I am proud to have been the first Emirati female to join the
St. Andrews Summer program. Throughout my academic journey, I have
undertaken several projects that have revolved around robotics and
technology. These projects include

1.  A small robot that assists students and teachers in transferring
    > books and supplements between school halls,

2.  A robot designed to detect and clean solar panels once a specific
    > threshold of dustiness is reached,

3.  A drone equipped with a First Aid Kit and 360 cameras to aid in
    > critical situations such as wars, fires, and for emergency
    > responders.
